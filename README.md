# ELIZA Resources

This repository contains some of my favorite resources on ELIZA, Joseph Weizenbaum's AI written in 1966. It includes the original Source in MAD-SLIP, various basic renditions for Altair 8k, Commodore 64, and MSDOS, aswell as the Creative Computing Article from 1977 where the BASIC version was first released to the public.
