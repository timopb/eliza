/*  This is a recreation of Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966 ELIZA. The code was
    written from scratch originally using only the description in the
    Weizenbaum's paper on page 36 of the January 1966 edition of
    Communications of the ACM as a guide.

    If given the same S-expression-like script from the appendix of that
    paper, and given the same prompt text, the conversation it generates
    is identical to the conversation shown in the paper.

    I made this for my amusement and hereby place it in the public domain
    or, if you prefer, I release it under either CC0 1.0 Universal or the
    MIT License.

    Update: In April 2021 Jeff Shrager obtained a listing of ELIZA from
    Weizenbaum's MIT archive. In May 2021 he got permission from
    Weizenbaum's estate to open source the code under CC0 1.0. Seeing
    his original code clarified some behavior that was not fully
    documented in the CACM paper. (Although the listing was not dated
    and appears to differ from the functionality described in the CACM
    paper.) I made changes to this code to reflect what I learned. These
    changes are documented in the code.

    Update: In April 2022 Jeff Shrager located the source code to SLIP,
    including the HASH function. I made hash used in this code use the
    same algorithm.

    Note: In the code below there are occasional references to
    Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966 CACM article. A reference like
    [page X (Y)] refers to paragraph Y on page X of that publication.

    The mnemonics used in HASH
        ANA = and to accumulator
        ARS = accumulator right shift
        CLA = clear AC and add (AC is the accumulator)
        LDQ = load MQ (MQ is the multiplier-quotient register)
        LLS = long left shift (AC/MQ shifted as if they were one register)
        MPY = multiply bits 1-35 of MQ with bits 1-35 of specified value
              to give a 72-bit result in AC/MQ and overflow bits P and Q
        PZE = prefix of plus zero (assembles a single machine word with a
              plus zero as its prefix)
        STA = store address; copy bits 21-35 in the AC (the 15 least-
              significant bits) to the specified location, leaving the
              other bits in the destination unchanged
        TRA = transfer to specified address (aka jump)
        ZAC = zero the accumulator

    Bits in an IBM 7090 instruction word are labeled
        S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 .. 20 21 22 23 .. 33 34 35
        <--- operation code ---->          <---- address ----->
    Where S is the sign bit and bit 1 is the most-significant data bit

    FAP lines have the format

            <op>    <address>,<tag>,<decrement>

    In the <address> field, * means "present location," so STA *+2 means
    store accumulator to present location + 2.

    Also in the <address> field ** means value provided at run time.
    i.e. HASH uses self-modifying code.

    An <op> mnemonic followed by an asterisk indicates indirect addressing
    is to be used. The <tag> field specifies which of the 7090's three index
    registers, numbered 1, 2 and 4, is to be used. In this code it looks
    like index register 4 is some kind of stack frame pointer, so the
    parameters D and N and the return address are at offsets 1, 2 and 3
    respectively to the address stored in this index register.

    One thing to note: the datum may represent 6 6-bit characters,
    i.e. 36 bits. But the top bit of MQ and AC is the sign bit. So the
    top bit of the first character in the given D will be assumed to
    be a sign bit and will not be part of the 35-bit multiplication,
    except as a sign. The value of the HASH function is taken from the
    bits near the middle of D squared, so while N is small the loss
    of the top bit has no effect on the result.

// recreate the SLIP HASH function: return an n-bit hash value for
// the given 36-bit datum d, for values of n in range 0..15
int hash(uint_least64_t d, int n)
{
    /*  This code implements the SLIP HASH algorithm from the FAP
        code shown above.

        The function returns the middle n bits of d squared.
        This kind of hash is known as mid-square.

        The IBM 7094 uses sign-magnitude representation of integers:
        in a 36-bit integer, the most-significant bit is assumed to
        be the sign of the integer, and the least-significant 35-bits
        are assumed to be the magnitude of the integer. Therefore,
        in the SLIP HASH implementation only the least-significant
        35-bits of D are squared. When the datum holds six 6-bit
        characters the top bit of the first character in the given D
        will be assumed to be a sign bit and will not be part of
        the 35-bit multiplication (except as a sign).

        On the IBM 7094 multiplying two 35-bit numbers produces a
        70-bit result. In this code that 70-bit result will be
        truncated to 64-bits. (Unsigned arithmetic overflow is not
        undefined behavior, as it is for signed arithmetic.) If n
        is 15, the middle 15 bits of a 70-bit number are bits 42-28
        (bit 0 least significant), which is well within our 64-bit
        calculation. */

    /* 2. From published conversation in the CACM paper

        In the CACM published script, the MEMORY S-expression is

            (MEMORY MY
                (0 YOUR 0 = LETS DISCUSS FURTHER WHY YOUR 3)
                (0 YOUR 0 = EARLIER YOU SAID YOUR 3)
                (0 YOUR 0 = BUT YOUR 3)
                (0 YOUR 0 = DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR 3))

        In the CACM published conversation, the memory is formed
        by the input sentence

            "Well, my boyfriend made me come here."

        In the ELIZA code, these lines choose the MEMORY rule

            OR W'R KEYWRD .E. MEMORY                                     001220

             NEWBOT.(REGEL.(MYTRAN(I),INPUT,LIST.(MINE)),MYLIST)         001240

        That's the HASH of the BOT (last cell) of the user's INPUT sentence,
        with a 2-bit result. MYTRAN (containing the 4 MEMORY rules) is indexed
        on the value returned by HASH plus 1.

        Later, ELIZA says

            "DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE"

        So, the value returned by HASH in this case must have been 3 in order
        to select the correct rule...

            (0 YOUR 0 = DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR 3)

        Hence this test: HASH of "HERE" must be 3.

    ELIZA was written in SLIP for an IBM 7094. The character encoding
    used on the 7094 is called Hollerith. The Hollerith encoding
    uses 6 bits per character. The IBM 7094 machine word size is
    36-bits.

    SLIP stores strings in SLIP cells. A SLIP cell consists of two
    adjacent machine words. The first word contains some type bits
    and two addresses, one pointing to the previous SLIP cell and
    the other pointing to the next SLIP cell. (The IBM 7094 had a
    32,768 word core store, so only 15 bits are required for an
    address. So two addresses fit into one 36-bit word with 6 bits
    spare.) The second word may carry the "datum." This is where
    the characters are stored.
    
    Each SLIP cell can store up to 6 6-bit Hollerith characters.

    If a string has fewer than 6 characters, the string is stored left-
    justified and space padded to the right.

    So for example, the string "HERE" would be stored in one SLIP cell,
    which would have the octal value 30 25 51 25 60 60.

    If a string has more than 6 characters, it is stored in successive
    SLIP cells. Each cell except the last has the sign bit set in the
    first word to indicated the string is continued in the next cell.

    So the word "INVENTED" would be stored in two SLIP cells, "INVENT"
    in the first and "ED    " in the second.

    In ELIZA, the user's input text is read into a SLIP list, each word
    in the sentence is in it's own cell, unless a word needs to be
    continued in the next cell because it's more than 6 characters long.

    When ELIZA chooses a MEMORY rule it hashes the last cell in the
    input sentence. That will be the last word in the sentence, or
    the last chunk of the last word, if the last word is more than
    6 characters long.

    This code doesn't use SLIP cells. A std::deque of std::string
    provided enough functionality to manage without SLIP. In this
    code, every word is contained in one std::string, no matter
    how long.

    Given the last word in a sentence, the last_chunk_as_bcd function
    will return the 36-bit Hollerith encoding of the word, appropriately
    space padded, or the last chunk of the word if over 6 characters long.

/*  The ELIZA script contains the opening_remarks followed by rules.
    (The formal syntax is given in the elizascript namespace below.)
    There are two types of rule: keyword_rules and memory_rules.

    Each keyword_rule may perform some sort of transformation on a
    user input sentence. Rules are generally triggered by the
    appearance of a particular keyword in the user input text. So one
    way to model the script is to std::map the keyword to the associated
    rule.

    Here are the two rule types.

namespace elizascript { // reader for 1966 ELIZA script file format


/*  This is my understanding of the ELIZA script file from the explanation
    in the CACM article and observation of the example script given in the
    APPENDIX to the CACM article:

    The script is a series of S-expressions. The first S-expression is a list
    of words that ELIZA will emit at startup [page 42 (a)]. This may be
    followed by the atom START. Following that are the pattern-matching and
    message assembly Rules. Finally, there may be an empty list.

    e.g.
        (HOW DO YOU DO.  PLEASE TELL ME YOUR PROBLEM)
        START
        <Rules>
        ()

    The following modified BNF is used to define the ELIZA script syntax.

        x : y

    Things on the left of the colon must be replaced by (or "produce") the
    things on the right, and things on the right of the colon are either
    terminals or must also appear on the left in some other rule.
    In addition, things on the right may be sequences, choices or repetitions:

        x y     means there must be an x followed by a y here
        x|y     means there must be either x or y here
        [x]     means there must be zero or one of x here
        {x}     means there must be zero of more x here; note that {x|y}
                produces, for example, x, y, xx, yy, xy, yx, xyx, xyxxy, ...
        'x'     means literally x, a terminal

    The ELIZA script syntax:

    eliza_script        : opening_remarks ['START'] rules ['(' ')']
    opening_remarks     : '(' {word} ')'
    rules               : {keyword_rule | memory_rule}

    keyword_rule        : '(' keyword
                            ['=' substitute_word]
                            [precedence]
                            ['DLIST' tags]
                            {transformation}

                            '(' decompose_terms '=' reassemble_terms ')'
                            '(' decompose_terms '=' reassemble_terms ')'

    substitute_word     : word
    precedence          : INTEGER
    reference           : '(' '=' keyword ')'

    transformation      : '(' decompose_pattern
                               reassemble_rule {reassemble_rule} ')'
    decompose_pattern   : '(' decompose_terms ')'
    decompose_terms     : decompose_term {decompose_term}
    decompose_term      : word | match_count | tags | any_of
    match_count         : INTEGER
    tags                : '(' '/' word {word} ')'
    any_of              : '(' '*' word {word} ')'

    reassemble_rule     : reassemble_pattern
                        | reference
                        | newkey
                        | pre_transform_ref

    reassemble_pattern  : '(' reassemble_terms ')'
    reassemble_terms    : reassemble_term {reassemble_term}
    reassemble_term     : word | match_index
    match_index         : INTEGER
    newkey              : '(' 'NEWKEY' ')'
    pre_transform_ref   : '(' 'PRE' reassemble_pattern reference ')'

    word                : word_char {word_char}
    word_char           : A-Z | SINGLE-QUOTE


    Note that whitespace is ignored, except where it is necessary to separate
    symbols that would otherwise merge. For example, two adjacent words need
    at least one space between them to stop them merging into one.

    To the syntax we must add these semantic rules

    1. No two keyword_rules may have the same keyword.

    2. If there are multiple transformation rules, the decompose_pattern of
    each is tried in turn and the first that successfully matches the user's
    input text is selected. One of the decompose_patterns must match the
    user's input, unless the transformation rules are followed by a reference.

    3. If a transformation has multiple reassemble_rules they are used in
    turn: the first time a decompose_pattern matches a user's input the first
    reassemble_rule is used to create ELIZA’s response. The next time the
    user's input matches the same decompose_pattern the second reassemble_rule
    is used, and so on. When they have all been used a subsequent match will
    begin again with the first reassemble_rule.

    4. There must be exactly one memory_rule. The keyword associated with the
    memory_rule must also be the keyword in one of the keyword_rules.

    5. There must be a keyword_rule for the special keyword NONE. This rule
    must have a decompose_pattern that matches any text, (0), and associated
    "content-free" remarks, such as "PLEASE GO ON". It must not have a
    substitute_word, precedence or any DLIST tags.

    6. Any tag word referenced in a decompose_pattern must also be associated
    with at least one keyword via the DLIST mechanism.

    7. match_count will match the specified number of words, but doesn't
    specify what the words are. So a match_count of 2 means there must be two
    words here, but they can be any two words. A match_count of 0 means there
    can be any number, including none, of any words here.

    8. match_index is a 1-based index of the parts matching the
    decompose_pattern. For example, a decompose_pattern (A 1 0) will match the
    text "A HILL OF BEANS" and when associated with the reassemble_pattern
    (FIRST 1 SECOND 2 THIRD 3) will produce the output "FIRST A SECOND HILL
    THIRD OF BEANS."

    9. There must exist a keyword_rule for any keyword referred to in a
    (=keyword) reference.

    10. An infinite loop may be created if keyword_rule A has a reference to
    itself or to another keyword_rule, which either refers directly back to A
    or refers back to A via one or more other keyword_rules. In this case
    ELIZA would generate no response message. Weizenbaum does not explicitly
    disallow this. This looping mechanism is fundamental to the possibility
    that ELIZA scripts are Turing complete; looping via the pre_transform_ref
    rule is not necessarily infinite.

    11. The script has the word START following the opening_remarks, and ends
    with an empty list. Both these elements are present in Weizenbaum's
    published DOCTOR script, but he doesn't mention them in the CACM paper.
    The purpose of the START symbol isn't clear, but the ELIZA source code
    appears to use an empty list as a sentinel signaling the end of the
    script. Both elements are included in this formal script syntax as
    optional.
